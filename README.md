### Hi there, this is Barbara ðŸ‘‹

I am a junior developer from Granada, Spain. I introduced myself to coding in november 2021. After studying JavaScript, I learnt Java and MySQL. Honestly, I feel more comfortable working the backend area instead of being front-end. You can check my other social media webs, clicking on the link below. Follow me! ðŸ˜„

### What am I doing now?

Well, once I am here I knew I had to keep learning constantly so I decided to try Spring framework. At the same time, I am looking for a remote or hybrid job for me!
